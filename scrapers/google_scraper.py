# with whatever it has collected so far, instead of being cut off cold by
# the outer timeout and losing partial results. Now only the FIRST call for
# a given business actually reaches this budget - every other product job
# for the same company is served from the cache in _CACHE_LOCK-protected
# dict below and returns near-instantly.
#
# WIDENED 18 -> 35 based on direct production-log evidence: a single failed
# then slow-but-successful navigation retry sequence was observed consuming
# ~24s by itself (attempt 1 using its full ~9s timeout, attempt 2 using
# most of its ~7.8s allotment) - before the ~2.1s of fixed settle waits or
# _PLACE_RESULT_LOOP_MIN_TIME_SECONDS's own 8s floor are even accounted
# for. Both NAV_TIMEOUT_MS_MIN/MAX (config.py) scale UP as more budget is
# available, so simply adding a few seconds back (as an earlier pass at
# this fix did, 18->22) does not reliably solve it: worst case nav alone
# can still consume up to ~21s (two attempts at the 12s ceiling minus
# backoff), which left only ~1s of real margin at 22s - not enough to
# clear the 8s place-result-loop floor. 35s leaves ~14s of margin after
# that worst-case nav for settle waits, layout detection, and the loop's
# own minimum, which is enough headroom based on what's been observed -
# but page-load timing is network-dependent and should be validated
# against real traffic; treat this as a strong first pass, not a

# --- ROOT-CAUSE FIX (see _scrape_maps' place-result loop below) ----------
# Minimum time_left() required to even ENTER the place-result selector
# loop. This used to be hardcoded to 15 inline, which - combined with the
# ~4-5s of fixed overhead that's always spent before this loop is reached
# (initial nav + the 1800ms/300ms settle waits + consent dismissal +
# bot-check + _detect_maps_layout) - meant time_left() was *already* at or
# below 15 on essentially every single call, every time, regardless of
# company. The loop's own `break` fired on its very first check, before a
# single selector was ever tried, and did so silently (no log line), which
# is exactly why every business in the production logs (Concept Kart, boAt
# Lifestyle, Xiaomi India, Sony - completely unrelated companies) failed
# identically with "no place-result selector matched in time": nothing was
# ever actually attempted. Every other time-budget guard in this file (see
# the `_wait_for_review_panel`, review-tab hunt, and scroll-loop checks
# below) uses 6-12 as its "give up" threshold, not 15 - this constant
# brings the place-result loop back in line with that convention.
#
# NOTE: lowering this threshold alone was not sufficient on its own - it
# was still observed going negative (-5.8s) in production even at 8,
# because TIME_BUDGET_SECONDS itself (see above) was too small for a
# failed-then-successful nav retry sequence to fit inside. Both fixes are
# required together: this threshold controls how much time the loop needs
# once reached; TIME_BUDGET_SECONDS controls whether that much time is
# realistically ever left over.

# into one, so on a direct-redirect it logged "could not click place
# result" and then blindly kept going anyway - which happened to still
# work sometimes, but gave no real signal about *why* review collection

            a fully-resolved "/maps/place/..." href at scrape time, but a

            (the anchor's click is *not* a native link follow - Maps calls
            preventDefault() and does an internal SPA transition instead),
            which can race the results list's virtualization or get
            swallowed as a hover/preview instead of a navigation. Since we
            already have the destination URL as a plain string, going
            straight there via goto() is more reliable than depending on

            with the click-based approach kept as a fallback for the rare

    # had a 4s wait, so the whole loop burned 30-40s before falling through
    # with nothing found, by which point the time budget was exhausted.

    # fast. On failure, use JS-injection to walk the live DOM directly.

# Business-level cache + single-flight coalescing.
#
# Google Reviews belong to the business, not to an individual product, but
# app.py schedules one job per selected product (plus one "General" job),
# each calling scrape_google_reviews with a query like "{company} {product
# name}". Previously every one of those jobs opened its own Google Maps
# session — for 5 selected products that's 5 full Playwright scrapes,
# which is exactly why "Google Review Collection" dominates the runtime in
# the production log.
#
# Fix: cache the collected reviews per business (keyed by the company's
# website, which is identical across every job for one analysis run,
# unlike company_name which gets a product suffix appended) and, if a
# scrape for that business is already running when another job asks for
# it, await that same in-flight scrape instead of starting a second one.
# The result: one analysis run does at most ONE real Maps scrape no
# matter how many products were selected, and every job gets the same
# review set. A later, separate analysis of the same company still gets a
# fresh scrape once GOOGLE_REVIEW_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS has elapsed.
#
# This lives entirely inside this module so app.py's per-product job
# structure, function names, and call signatures don't need to change.
